## Installation

- The installation process is fairly easy, one will have to download the NPM 'Inquirer' to prompt the user with questions, the other NPM package that will be needed is called 'console-table', this allows a table to be generated in the console. And lastly and most importantly with using MySQL you are able to create tables for the database and for the user to query their requested data.

## Usage

- The Employee-Tracker application allows the user to view and manipulate the company's database by adding and viewing the employees, their roles, salaries, and managers. The user is also able to update and create an employee if they'd wished to do so.
